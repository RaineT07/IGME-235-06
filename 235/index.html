                I am a third year New Media Interactive Development major here at RIT!
                I am also undergoing a minor in photography and an immersion in the japanese language. This class will be helpful for developing front-end interactions and experiences,
                and will be excellent experience in learning more about interaction design and development. My major will be helpful in getting high-level experience with programming front-end and back-end, which will hopefully help me secure a good job in the field so I can eventually work my way towards a personal goal of mine. 
                I have always wanted to be a game designer and developer, particularly in the storytelling and worldbuilding aspect of game design. I am at heart a storyteller and writer, and while that is not what I want professionally it is an incredibly important aspect of my life.
                My time at RIT has really pushed me into the kind of person I've always wanted to become, and I hope it continues to do so. When I graduate, I want to be able to work hard at a well-paying, respectable job so I can hopefully own a house and begin work on my own personal projects like developing indie games, or writing stories, or anything else I might set my sights on in the future.
