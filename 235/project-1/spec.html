                        When visitors pass through RIT's main entrance, 
                        one of their first impressions of the campus is the outdoor athletic fields. 
                        And that view is getting a facelift.
                        The first phase of the multimillion-dollar project is the relocation of the outdoor track to a new area and with an upgraded synthetic running surface. 
                        The baseball and softball fields are also under construction with upgrades to all-weather artificial turf fields. All three venues will be ready for spring competition.
                        Next up: the installation of

                        a state-of-the-art artificial turf field as well as the construction of 
                        a full stadium complex featuring locker rooms, training facilities, concessions, a press box, and premium suites. 
                        The stadium will be home to men's and women's lacrosse as well as men's and women's soccer.
                        A grand concourse will also flow between the stadium and the Gordon Field House, 
                        which will benefit athletics but also other major events, including commencement ceremonies.
                        “These facilities will be seen as a new entry point for campus

                        and will create great exposure for RIT Athletics,” said Jacqueline
                        Nicholson, executive director of Intercollegiate Athletics.
                        “When you come on campus, you will soon see four new 
                        athletic facilities—a true focal point for Tiger spirit.”
                        RIT has two Division I teams—men's hockey and women's hockey—and 22
                        Division III teams that compete in the Liberty League. 
                        In addition, thousands of students participate in club and intramural sports.
