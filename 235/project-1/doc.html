    <h2>goal of site</h2>
    <p>This site will become a website detailing a nice chocolate chip cookie recipe. thus, one needs to be able to have good instructions as well as a good view of what the process looks like, which as gone into consideration during my design process. my audience is anyone! but mostly people who like to bake.</p>
