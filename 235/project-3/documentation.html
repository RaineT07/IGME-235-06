    <h1>dungeon crawlers documentation</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>process: </strong>I started by getting a few baseline rooms that were randomly generated, and getting that random generation working.<br>
        after that, I worked on making sure the sprites and the html elements were working properly so that as you ran through the experience, the website would not be bogged down<br>
        by spans being created but never destroyed. Next, I worked on expanding the boundaries of the map so that you could keep moving through an infinitely generating space. <br>
        finally, I added in the actual map functionality, so that you can move through the world and actually have it make logical sense. you could return to rooms you previously had been to<br>
        by taking a different route to them. I made extra sure to try not to repeat myself as much as I possibly could, and have my code be as sound as possible. <br>
        Unique sprites and sounds are used, and the instructions are also added on in case it wasn't clear how to activate doors especially. 
        <br> The most important and interesting thing to me is the map system. That was the biggest challenge I faced and I'm glad I could overcome it with some good planning.
