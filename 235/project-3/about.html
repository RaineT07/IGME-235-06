    <h1>Random dungeon project!</h1>
    <h3>features:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>randomly generated every time: procedurally generated so that no 2 games look the same</li>
        <li>different enemy types: charging enemy, patroling enemy, and ranged enemy</li>
        <li>TREASURE!</li>
        <li>bonus areas: a big treasure will be on the opposite side of a room full of enemies that shoot stuff at you. navigate the room without getting shot to get the big cash money wad!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>this game will be a top down tile map based adventure game where you go through a procedurally generated labyrinth that expands as you play.<br>
    this is done by creating an empty 2d array that starts with just the one map object, which acts as 0,0. as you explore the map, <br>the 2d array is added to in such a way that the 2d array will eventually become a map of it's own, for the dungeon itself.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>this will be a 25x25 tile map for each room, with water traps that slow your speed and locked areas that require a key item somewhere else in the room. some items will incllude:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>extra hearts</li>
        <li>amulet of increased value: double the value of treasure when you have this item</li>
        <li>immortality crystal! revive once at full health if you die in the game.</li>
        <li>key! (unlocks doors)</li>
        <li>skeleton key! (super rare)</li>
        <li>swimming flippers (negates the slow effect in water)</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h5>note: unfortunately since this is a randomly generated map, it's kinda hard to make sketches of it.</h5>
